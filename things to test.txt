things to test


- trained on grainy vs smooth
- trained on smooth animation vs smooth real-life video
- optical flow:
	- using more adv optical flow on grainy video for test, vs smooth animation
		- adv optical flow package or could use "n>3" filtering for frame selection (avoid frozen frames)

- need to test on separate video from mixed training set

- messing with crop size as a hyperparameter
