!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
everything under here is old
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

- code as borrowed - will need to install CUDA, CuPy to run
- current data processing script on our and prev developer's sides don't really mesh super cleanly (very different ways of indexing the data)
	- splitting into X/Y training dictionaries vs into a simpler list of triples
- made changes in the database init file TorchDB.py, need to propogate through other files

- changed data_import.py to output a single training dictionary with frames stacked in 1,3,2 order 
- changed TorchDB to pull 3 frames from the training dictionary in the get_item function and to call data_import functions to set up training database

making changes again to how we handle data flow (for the last time)

pseudocode:
start with a bunch of unprocessed videos in a particular directory that always stays the same
read the videos into [a] frame dictionary[ies?] having ben's basic frame dict structure
divide the frame dictionary (s) into training dictionaries and test dictionaries
pickle them into new directory locations (train file and test file)

from train/test code, unpickle the frame dictionaries and do any necessary cropping/frame level processing
train or test or whatever


when finished should we also delete the pickled frame dictionaries and always be starting with those files not in our master directory? maybe :shrug:
