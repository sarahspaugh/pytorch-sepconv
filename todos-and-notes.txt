getting running
----------------
- code as borrowed - will need to install CUDA, CuPy to run
- current data processing script on our and prev developer's sides don't really mesh super cleanly (very different ways of indexing the data)
	- splitting into X/Y training dictionaries vs into a simpler list of triples
- made changes in the database init file TorchDB.py, need to propogate through other files 

1/3/2020 17:29
- changed data_import.py to output a single training dictionary with frames stacked in 1,3,2 order 
- changed TorchDB to pull 3 frames from the training dictionary in the get_item function and to call data_import functions to set up training database

pre-training data processing

- todo: make a new script that cuts video files into the "training" videos and the "test" videos, and saves them in sub-directories accordingly
